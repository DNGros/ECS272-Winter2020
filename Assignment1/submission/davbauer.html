        <p>Shows current and historic wind data across the US. Wind direction and speed are shown using particle animation.</p>
          
        <p>The visualization is interactive. The user can zoom and pan using the mouse. Furthermore, there are tooltips on hover showing details about the location pointed at.
        <br>
        The color palette is gray. Wind speeds are indicated through brightness and animation speed of the particles. There is a legend showing examplary speeds and what they look like on the map.</p>
      
        <p>The visualization is decent. Color could have been used more to emphasize speeds or directions.</p>
