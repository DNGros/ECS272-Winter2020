      <p>This visualization shows the national unemployment by career sector. This visualization incorporates interactivity and each small dot on the graph above can be hovered on with a mouse to reveal which career sector it represents and the specific gain or loss percentage for the particular month and year. It uses different colors to represent different percentages. It uses histogram. I think it is a good visualization since it is easy for the readers to understand it. Besides, its interactivity and colorful picture attract the readers.
