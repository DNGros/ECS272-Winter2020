        <p> Mini Tokyo 3D is a live visualization of Tokyo transportation systems. 
          It is an interactive visualization, and users can use their mouses to choose the trains, buses, aircrafts they are curious about.
          They can also use their mouses to zoom the view. </p>

        <p>
          This visualization shows the position of each vehicle based on the map of Tokyo. It utilizes the color pattern of the Tokyo Subway, so that the users
          who are familiar with the Tokyo Subway can easily understand the map.
        </p>

        <p>
          I think this visualization is very interesing. However, the view is a little messy. Maybe it is caused by the complicity of Tokyo transportation systems, rather than the visualization tools.
          Nevertheless, I like this visualization because it shows many details I would like to know with an easy-to-use interactive user interface.
