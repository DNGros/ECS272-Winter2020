<p>This image displays the daily schedule of some of the world&rsquo;s most famous artists, writers, and musicians broken down by time and activity type.</p>
<p>The interesting and distinct point about this data visualization is that the raw data is collected from a book, &ldquo;Daily Rituals&rdquo;, by Mason Curry, 2007. The author of this book uses brief bios and vignettes to describe the daily rituals of famous Creatives. However, Podio which is a company supplies a web-based platform for organizing team communication not only wisely uses this interesting data to visualize the daily life of creatives but also to introduce its own brand. Therefore, I think it is a good visualization.</p>
<p>Stacked Bar Graphs are used to show the type of activity and its duration. The horizontal axis in the above of the image shows the hours during a day from 12 am to 12 pm and colors have their definitions: For example, Blue-green shows the sleep hours or orange shows creative work duration. By hovering over the colored bars, it gives more detailed information. As an example, the green dye which illustrated day job, for Mozart was &ldquo;Giving music lesson&rdquo; bit for Kafka was &ldquo;Working at the worker&rsquo;s accident insurance institute&rdquo;. This visualization is static because users cannot change which data they see and how it's processed.</p>
