        <p>This visualization depicts the estimated human years lost due to gun violence in the year 2013 in USA.</p>
		<p>The visualization is interactive. You can hover over each of the strands and the victim's death information pops up. Clicking on a strand redirects to a news article about the crime and the death. There are also multiple filters available.</p>
		<p>Each line represents an individual who was a victim of gun violence. The orange part of the line represents the lifespan, and the grey part of the line represents the projected lifespan had the person died of natural causes. The summation of the years represented by the grey portions of the lines is the total years of human life lost due to gun violence in that year.</p>
		<p>I think this is an excellent visualization. The choice of colors is vibrant and very thoughtful. The lines are split into a rich color to express that the individual was alive and a dull color to express that the individual was dead at those points in time. Additionally, they have chosen to display an impactful metric to further emphasize the gravity of the issue the visualization tries to depict. Also the interactivity is fluid.</p>
