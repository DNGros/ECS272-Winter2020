        <p>It's a “age pyramid” called by demographers. Each bar represents a five year age cohort; with those ages 0-4 on the bottom and those ages 85 and older on the top. It's interactive, because users can choose one specific year as the input and get the population distribution as the output. When users choose a different year each time, they can get the corresponding population distribution immediately. The response time is short. I also think it's a good visualization example. It puts all the demographic data in a GIF image. From the GIF image, you can see the dynamic trends of population.</p>
