        <p>This visualization shows us the global Research & Education multigigabit optical network infrastructure owned by the GLIF members, where GLIF is a virtual organization consisting of network providers, network engineers and scientists. The figure represents the optical networks interconnection and interoperation in terms of educational usage, instead of production usage. The visualization is a static one. It uses Earth image provided by NASA with texture retouching. Personally, I think it is a good visualization, because it's clear and impressive. We can get a lot of inferences from this figure, e.g. the interconnection of optical networks appears less in Africa. The Authors also use different colors to show different connections, which makes the visualization more informative and intuitive.  </p>
