        <p>The visualization shows the prosperity level of different states and counties in the United States. The visualization is interactive, by hovering the mouse on different parts of the map, one can see the vitality index of each states. By clicking each state, one can then see the vitality index of different conties within the state. The visualization is portrayed on a map, which took the benefit of geographical visaulization. The choice of distinct colors(blue and orange) made it easy to observe the difference between the vitalities of each state/county. The purpose of the visualization is to inform. I think this is a good visualization because it is self-explaining and easy to understand.</p>
