        <h3>What is being shown?</h3>
        <p>The interactive visual shows the global share and gross import/export of various commodities such as gold, copper, natural gas and oil for various countries all over the world. 
        </p>
        <h3>Is the visualization interactive or static? If interactive, how can it be interacted with?</h3>
        <p>
          <h4>01. The globe/country</h4>
            <li> The visualization is interactive. To interact with it, rotate the globe using cursor</li>
            <li> Saerch for a particular country in the search option at the bottom to get the commodity information for a particular country.</li>
          <h4>02. Filtering</h4>
            <li>User can filter commodity share for a particular country for a particular year on the timeline using the adjust button at the bottom.</li>
            <li>Colours on the towers correspond to particular commodities for each country</li>
          </p>
          <h3>What, in your opinion, is the rationale behind the design choices?</h3>
            <p>I think the design of interactive globe is to increase user interaction and the color palette is also good since all the colours are in contrast to each other to easily identify among commodities. The tower size depicts teh share of that country globally which the user can understand intuitively.</p>
          <h3>Do you think this is a good visualization? Give a short critique on why or why not.</h3>
            <p>I think the visualization is pretty good. It gives the user all the possible parameters to tweak the data and get the information they want correctly. For exxample, it gives the user the option to change the year, commodity type and country all within the same visualization. Also, the color palette is really interesting and the motion of teh globe is amazing. In order to know a more accurate commodity division for a country, user can move the globe to see the towers from the side.</p>
