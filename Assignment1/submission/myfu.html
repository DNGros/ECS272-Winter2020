        <p><Strong> What is being shown?</Strong> The above picture shows an example of t-SNE visualization. It is one way to tackle high dimensional visualization problems. </p>
        <p><Strong> Is the visualization interactive or static?</Strong> The t-SNE visualization is static. </p>
        <p><Strong> What, in your opinion, is the rationale behind the design choices?</Strong> Instead of trying to maintain the global structure, as what was implemented by many other dimensionality reduction methods, t-SNE tries to group local data points closer to each other. </p>
        <p><Strong> Do you think this is a good visualization? </Strong> I think it's a good visualization method, grouping local data points closer to each other is a better match for building human reasoning.  </p>
