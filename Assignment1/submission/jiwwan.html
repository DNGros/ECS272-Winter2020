			This picture describes the origin of Christmas trees produced in 2017. The more Christmas trees produced, the bigger green triangle will be. And it is a static visualization. There are several interesting visualization techniques used in the picture. First, all information is shown on the US map, so that we can clearly identify where these Christmas trees are from based on our daily geography experience. So that there is no need to make extra explanation. Secondly, green triangle is used to represent the amount of trees produced in one county. It is a perfect geometric abstraction of Christmas tree. Last, these green triangles are semitransparent, which makes the deeper green color of area with large amount of Christmas trees. The difference of green makes viewer associate the difference between several trees and a whole forest and comprehend the 'concentration distribution property' easily which is hidden in the data. Overall, I think it is a pretty good visualization because it shows us the object(Christmas tree), characteristic (amount distribution) of data in a very straightforward way.
