  	<ul>
  		<li>
  			This visualization shows in California state, the percentage of different ways of water usage and supplies in multiple areas that are splitted by rivers zones from the year 1998 to 2015 using pie charts.
		</li>
		<li>
			The visualization is interactive. The users can hover over different areas on the map of California. The options are the users could keep the part only or exclude the part out of the water evaluations, so that not only can the users click a zone represents a river area specifically on the map to see the distributions of how the water is used or supplied in specific years, but also they could see the data visualized in pie charts to evaluate the whole California state water resources.
		</li>
		<li>
			This visualization utilizes different colors to represents various river zones in California, and different sources of water usage and supplied. Pie charts are used to well show the percentage distributions. Interaction techniques such as zoom, details on demand are used.
		</li>
		<li>
			I think it is a good visualization because it shows a massive amount of information about the distributions of water usage and supplies sources of different zones divided by rivers in California between the year 1998 to 2015. The uses could compare and contrast the usage and supplies of the water information directly by some simple clicks.
