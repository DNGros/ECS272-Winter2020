      <p>Text for describing the visualization.</p>
      <p>This info visualization shows the type of food that are usually paired with certain wine. This visualization is static. The visualization technique
      it used is dividing the wine and food into two seperate parts and connects them. I think the rationale behind this choise of design is simply to
      show the relationship between two categories in a clear and concise way. I personally like this visualization because everyone has done this kind of exercise when they were young. Therefore,
      I believe it's intuitive for the user to reason through this visualization.</p>
