      <p> The picture above shows the price of "Big Mac" in different countries, they call it "The Big Mac Index".<br>
        The visualization itself is an iteractive application that allows users to choose different currencies and <br>
        the price at different certain amount of time. However, the image I embedded above is only one possible  <br>
        perspective of the iteractive application. The visualization utilized different colors to discriminate differences <br>
        in data. Both the graph and the map shows the difference between the price of "Big Mac" in the US and that of in <br>
        other countries. The smaller gaps were shown in yellow and larger gap were shown in red and blue, where red is for <br>
        significantly lower and blue is for significantly higher. The visualization uses both bar graph and world map to present<br>
        the number in different countries. Since it tried to show data in world-wide, choosing a map to show the data is very intuitive
        to the users, it is very straighforward. In my opinion, it is a good visualization, since it is self explanatory, and the <br>
        users and understand it with first sight. In addition, the visualization is also impactful, because the price the Big Mac<br>
        can show a country's agriculture cost, commoditties, labor, and even real-estate. I believe being meaningful is another<br>
        criteria of a good visualization.
