        <p>The static visualization shows the languages and their number of users. 
		Colors correspond to the continent of the countries where the languages are spoken and the size represents the relative quantity of users.
		Within the same color, there are also sub-parts showing dialects of that language.
		At the bottom of the graph, some bar charts are used to show the number of countries in which one language is spoken,
		the most popular languages being learned around the world. </br> 
		In my opinion, the big circle shape represents our earth, and the size could intuitively show the number of native speakers. Black lines are just like borders between countries while different colors resemble the world map. I would think it is a good visualization, as it shows the relative quantity of speakers of various languages from different continents. Also, it make people to be aware of the fact that the world consists of this many languages, which may beyond people's stereotype images.</p>
