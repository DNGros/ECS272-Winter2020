        <p>This visualization is a video, and can be interacted with by 
        clicking the embedded video to make it play. It shows the time 
        light takes to travel relative to the inner planets of our solar 
        system. </p>
        <p>I think this is a very good visualization, as it does a good 
        job of showing how vast space is, with using the speed of light 
        as a visual measuring tool. It is well known that the speed of 
        light is the fastest anything can travel in the universe, and we
         see in the beginning of the video the representation of light 
         zipping around the Earth at a frantic pace. However, in the 
         next few clips, it shows the travel time of light just to get 
         to Mars from Earth, and we see the light beam slowly creeping 
         across the black emptiness of space. Next, it shows the beam 
         traveling from the sun to Earth, and it is moving even slower 
         across the dark backdrop.</p>
        <p>This visualization tells a story about how big the universe 
        really is. When even the fastest object in the universe takes 
        this long to travel just within our solar system, it emphasizes 
        how far apart things are in space, and how empty it is.</p>
