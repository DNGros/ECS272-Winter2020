        <p>This figure shows the recommendation for the pairing between wines and different food that is useful in daily life. It mentions 11 categories of food, including vegetables, cheese, different types of meat, carbo. The image is static, and it's easy to make it interactive once the links between food and wines could be responsive if the mouse hover over or click it. The image use different colors to distinguish different wines and food styles. The common pairs of food and wines are designed to have similar color. The similar types of wines are also close in terms to color. I believe it's reasonable since it's easy to see different links and figure out the categories of food and wines. I think this visualization is good because it's easy to see the main information which's the link between wines and food. And the image uses figures of food to reduce the workload of reading texts. The wine bottles are also slightly different to tell the difference between them. </p>
