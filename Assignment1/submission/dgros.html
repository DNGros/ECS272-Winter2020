        In this visualization by Randall Munroe, changes in earth's temperature is visualized. It starts at 20,000 years ago and continues to the modern day. The main point communicated is that historically temperature shifts slowly, but since the industrial revolution, we have seen an atypical and dramatic shift in global temperature due to human activity. It includes projects of temperture to into the future in order to create a sense of urgency to the problem.

The visualization is static, but it is at a large scale. The user is not able to physically see all of the visualization at once. They must scroll down the page to see more of the visualization. This interaction of scrolling emphasizes the scale of the time frame shown, and makes the change at the end seem even more dramatic.

I think this is a great visualization. It both has a very clear point, while at the same time it is engaging. The addition of illustrations add extra context and also makes it more fun to read. Because the user must take time to scroll all the way through the page, the inclusion of the illustrations rather than just the datapoint line makes it more likely they will stay until the end. The muted blue-red color scheme helps communicate the point and is visually pleasing. Overall, the visualization seems clear and well designed.
