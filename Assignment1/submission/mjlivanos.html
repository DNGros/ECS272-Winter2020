        <p>This static visualization describes reccomended types of food to pair with 
        different styles of wine. A pairing is denoted by a line drawn from
        the food to the wine. The color of the line is also an indicator of what
        style of wine the paring is for. This allows the viewer to quickly figure out which
        foods go which wines by viewing the color underneath the food group, or visa versa
        by scanning horizontally to see which colors are under which food groups.
        I enjoy this picture because of the artist's use of color to quickly
        convey information on a topic in either direction.</p>
