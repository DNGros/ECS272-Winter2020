        <p>This chart traces the army location and size over time during the Russian campaign. </p>
        <p>The website is interactive. Details of different events will pop up upon hovering. <br /> In addition, casualties and temperatures are also provided when dragging the button on the chart. </p>
        <p>The width of the band represents the size of the army. The color indicates advance or retreat of the army. <br /> Temperatures are also provided in a parallel line chart. </p>
        <p>In my opinion, this is a good example of visualization. The chart successfully visualizes locations, time, population and temperatures in a concise and explicit way.
