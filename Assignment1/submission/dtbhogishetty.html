        <p>The above visualization technique is called the Marimekko Chart (a static graph), and is used to visualize categorical data over a pair
        of variables. The above graph shows a comparison between 4 footwear brands and their U.S and international sales. The
      X-axis depicts the 4 brands and the Y-axis their sales in Millions of Dollars.
      <br/>
      The Marimekko Chart makes it easy for us to understand the relationships between categories of data. In this example,
      it is eay for us to see that Nike dominates the sales compared to its competitors. The cons of using the Marimekko Chart are
      that they can be hard to read when there are many segments, and it is difficult to make accurate comparisons between data segments.
