        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The webpage shows some basic information of a particular Nintendo Switch game 
        (for example, OKAMI HD), including MSRP, genre, overall score, price from each retailer and more. 
        Most of the visualization is static, except the price history. You can move the cursor over, 
        and it will show the price of this game from different retailers at a given time.
        It uses different color to represent diffent retailer on the diagram, although I have no clue about
        the color selection stradegy. It uses line chart to represent price history. I think it is a good 
        visualization because as a customer, we can clearly see how good the current discount is compare to 
        previous deals.</p>
