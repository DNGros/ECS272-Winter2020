          Image source: <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/cartoons/daily-cartoon/wednesday-january-1st-weight-gain">Change in weight through the months of the year.</a>
		  <br><br>
		  <b>What is being shown?</b>
		  A very intersting visualization of the weight gain over the different months of the year. Each curve adds an area which depicts the rate of weight added.
		  <br><br>
		  <b>Is the visualization interactive or static?</b>
		 The visualization is of a static form.
		 <br><br>
		  <b>Design choices and visualization techniques:</b>
		  The illustrator choses to tie the data to be visualized with a depiction of a phenomenon that occurs because of the change in the data.
		  <br>
		<br>
		  <b>Why these choices?</b>
		  The visualization takes in an image of the belly of a person and how it increases along the years.
		  Articules show men tend to have a pot belly, including me which happens to be the host of majority of the extra fat on the body.
		  <br><br>
		  <b>Do you think it is a good visaulization, why/ why not?</b>
		  I do not think it is the best way to visualize the data related to weight gain if we need to make analysis out of the curves drawn, but it sure is an interesting way to look at weight gain and labeling according to the month and the most probable food item along with it.
