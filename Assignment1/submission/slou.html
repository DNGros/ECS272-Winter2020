            The visualization could also be found <a href="https://www.metroman.cn/en/rail.html">here</a>, and mobile apps are also provided for <a href="https://metroman.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/railman/apk/RailManStable.apk">Android</a> and <a href=https://apps.apple.com/app/id1333834350>iOS</a> devices.

            This visualization illustrates an overall map of High-Speed Railway system in China. This visualization is not interactive at all. The mobile app version of this visualization also shows the approximate 'real-time' location of the trains (unfortunately, the locations seem to be calculated by the planned time intead of GPS information). It is obvious that there are many lines of High-Speed Railways in China, and as a result, different colors are chosen to represent each line. What is more, in some areas where the distribution of train stations is dense, the author chooses to show a more detailed view on the left hand side instead of enlarging the map directly (which may make the map much larger).

            In my point of view, this visualization is interesting, but not useful at all. The operator of China railway has never published a complete map of High-Speed Rail in China. As a result, for the public, especially for the train fans, a overall map of High-Speed Rail in China could be provided, including both the current service and the future plan. Nonetheless, this visualization may be useless to the travellers, or even misleading. On one hand, the trains don't stop at all stations, which means that the train may skip many station in one single line. On the other hand, the trains may switch to other lines in the middle instead of staying in one line forever. Therefore, the map seems useless for planning trips. In conclusion, this visualization is an interesting one, but a useless one as well.
