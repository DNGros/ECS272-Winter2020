      <p>This is a very interesting way to see what the general public of the world is talking about, and where. It is very interactive, where you can rotate, pan and zoom the globe. You can also select the time scale and the position on the globe. It uses the platform WebGL Globe, which provides some basic interactions with the globe. Different color of bars on the globe indicates different topics. The size of topic names indicates their popularity. 
	 The idea of the whole website is very interesting. It implements sentiment analysis to analyze all kinds of source of text on the internet to provide people with further information. The Geographical Data Analysis section pays more attention to the relationship between topics and location. This gives people great chance to know more about the place they are interested.
