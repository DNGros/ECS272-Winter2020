        <p>This is a visualization of averge points per shot earned by NBA players from 2013-14 to 2017-18 regarding to the shot locations.</p>
        <p>The visualization itself is static. It utilized colors and gradient plot to demonstrate the change of averge points per shot regarding to the position on field. Also it points out with text that shots outside 3-point line are still worth than elbow jumpers pointwise.</p>
        <p>In terms of a plot this visualization does a good job in reflecting the averge pointes earned positionwise. However, we also need to be a bit careful in interpreting the information. For example, the average point itself could not be used to draw conclusion alone without considering the total shots made regarding to the shot locations.</p>
